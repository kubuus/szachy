The Untitled General Chess Project

The current goal is to implement a working chess board which can accurately play chess and determine the legality of moves.

TODO list:
    1. Implement a proper moving function.
    2. A way of determining if someone is in check, checkmate, stalemate.
    3. System to interact with the program (probably by standard chess notation parser or something like that).

This project might seem convoluted and overenginnered, but this is because I may later repurpose it to be a chess engine,
and also because I've read an innapropriate amount of chessprogramming.org.

Cheers!
