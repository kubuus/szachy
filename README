The Untitled Chess Engine Project

The overall goal of this project is to enhance my C++ skills, and my managment of projects. 
Why I chose a chess engine still remains a mystery to me, but I really am having fun doing it.
Also while working on it I decided to start using Git for the first time, so here I am!

I've had a break from working because of university and personal issues, but I hope to be back on it soon.

The current goal is to implement a search architecture, and basic evaluation function.

TODO list:
    1. Implement a search tree complete with a alpha-beta algorithm.
    2. A simple evalution function with piece-boards and mobility.
    3. A way to interact with the program.
    
To everyone interested in this topic I can't recommend enough the chessproggraming.com wiki.

Cheers!
